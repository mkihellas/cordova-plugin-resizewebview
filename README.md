Cordova Resize Webview Plugin
=============================

I needed to make this because on a project I'm doing, a different plugin top send text messages messed up the webview. iOS only.

<p><b>Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gets the Webview's bounds</li>
  <li>Sets the Webview's bounds</li>
</ul>


If anyone likes this I'll write better documentation. Also, there's a lot more that can be done in this plugin anyway.
